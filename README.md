# ðŸ¤– SpringAI Chatbot

I developed **SpringAI**, an AI-powered chatbot application, to practice integrating AI models into a full-stack web application. The backend is built with **Spring Boot** and **Spring AI**, utilizing **Mistral AI** for natural language processing. The frontend is a dynamic **React** application, allowing users to interact with the chatbot seamlessly.
